# Room-Auto
# Room Automation System using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Aim
To design and simulate a room automation system for **remote monitoring and automatic control of a fan and room lamp** using Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual switching of appliances often causes **energy wastage** and **user inconvenience**.  
This project demonstrates an **IoT-based simulated solution** where the fan and lamp can be **monitored and controlled remotely** using Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## Scope
- Remote ON/OFF control of fan and lamp through a simulated IoT dashboard.
- Demonstrates **IoT concepts** without the need for real hardware.
- Can be extended to additional devices (AC, door locks, sensors).
- Educational value for students exploring **home automation** and **networking**.

## Required Components
| Category      | Items                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Software / IDE| Cisco Packet Tracer (v7.x or newer)          |
| Devices       | Smart Fan, Smart Lamp, Home Gateway / IoT Server |
| Optional      | PC / Mobile device for control, Sensors     |
| Hardware      | Not required (simulation only)              |

## Project Setup
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Add a **Home Gateway** and connect:
   - Smart Fan  
   - Smart Lamp
3. Configure each device with:
   - IoT server login  
   - Device name
4. Connect a **PC or Smartphone** in the same network.
5. Use the **IoT control panel** to **switch fan/lamp ON/OFF** or set **conditions**.
